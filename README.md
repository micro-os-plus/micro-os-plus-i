# µOS++ - the first edition

This project is the original µOS++, written in the mid 2000s,
initially for AVR-8 and later ported to AVR-32.

It was used in a seismograph, some SDI-12 sensors sold by
Metrilog GmbH
and the flight data recorder and acquisition modules
installed in the Remos G-3 ultralight owned by
Aviation Instruments SRL.

It was followed by **µOS++ SE** (second edition), in 2013,
which was more modular and included an experimental 
configuration mechanism inspired by eCos CDL.

The project is now archived, and preserved for historical
reasons.
